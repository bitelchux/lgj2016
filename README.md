Anyways, I've been using ES6 for a while in other personal projects, and I currently prefer it over ES5 and Typescript. 
I found the new Class-based syntax to be a better fit for my developer needs. Unfortunately, the best way to access
all the features of the new standard is by using a transpiler. This boilerplate is an attempt to reduce the time spent 
configurating a project and installing dependencies by providing a template that can work as an scaffold for any Phaser game.

## Building from source
